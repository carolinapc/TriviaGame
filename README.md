# Trivia Game

This is a trivia game about Canada. 

The game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

When the player selects an answer or runs out of time, a screen is shown with the result, and after a few seconds the next question will be displayed.

After all questions were displayed, is shown a summary with the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, unanswered and a button to restart the game.

If the user wins (more correct answers than the sum of incorrects and unanswered) the Canada National Anthem is played.
